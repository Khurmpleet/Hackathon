# Complete Uchebudike | Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! 🎉  
This project is part of my entry for a hackathon and represents my first fully built and styled web portfolio.

The site is built using **HTML** and **CSS**, with zero frameworks or libraries – just pure frontend fundamentals. It was created with beginner-friendly, readable code and clear comments to help anyone following along.
